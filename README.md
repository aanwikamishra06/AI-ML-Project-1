# AI-ML-Project-1
An autonomous delevery agent
my project works on a menu based system allowing user to choose the type of map they want the delivery agent to navigate.
The green blocks highlight the path to be followed 
the black and gray ones denote obstacles. 
The red one in the dynamic map is a moving obstacle hence path is mapped out accordingly 
the project is only a prototypa and can be developed furthure using actual aimages and animations. 
This is a basic python peoject using only pygame libraries.
